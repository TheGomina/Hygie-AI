The following prescriptions are potentially inappropriate to use in patients aged 65 years
and older.
Section A: Indication of medication
1. Any drug prescribed without a clinical indication.
2. Any drug prescribed beyond the recommended duration, where treatment duration is well
defined.
3. Any duplicate drug class prescription for daily regular use (as distinct from PRN use) e.g.,
two concurrent NSAIDs, SSRIs, loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors, anticoagulants, antipsychotics,
opioid analgesics (optimisation of monotherapy within a single drug class should be observed
prior to considering a new agent).
Section B: Cardiovascular System
1. Digoxin for heart failure with normal systolic ventricular function (no clear evidence of
benefit)
2. Verapamil or diltiazem with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (may worsen heart failure with

angina pectoris, aortic aneurysm or other condition where beta-blocker therapy is indicated
(no firm evidence of efficacy).
6. Amiodarone as first-line antiarrhythmic therapy in supraventricular tachyarrhythmias
(higher risk of major side-effects than beta-blockers, digoxin, verapamil or diltiazem).
7. Loop diuretic as first-line treatment for hypertension unless there is concurrent heart
failure requiring diuretic therapy (safer, more effective alternatives available).
8. Loop diuretic for dependent ankle oedema without clinical, biochemical or radiological
evidence of heart failure, liver failure, nephrotic syndrome or renal failure (leg elevation and
/or compression hosiery usually more appropriate).
9. Thiazide diuretic with current significant hypokalaemia (i.e., serum K+ < 3.0 mmol/l),
hyponatraemia (i.e., serum Na+ < 130 mmol/l) hypercalcaemia (i.e., corrected serum calcium
> 2.65 mmol/l) or with a history of gout (hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and
gout can be precipitated by thiazide diuretic)
10. Loop diuretic for treatment of hypertension with concurrent urinary incontinence (may
exacerbate incontinence).
11. Centrally-acting antihypertensives e.g., methyldopa, clonidine, moxonidine, rilmenidine,
guanfacine (centrally-active antihypertensives are generally less well tolerated by older

13. Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone) with concurrent potassium-
conserving drugs (e.g., ACEI’s, ARB’s, amiloride, triamterene) without monitoring of serum
potassium (risk of dangerous hyperkalaemia i.e., > 6.0 mmol/l – serum K should be monitored
regularly, i.e., at least every 6 months).

failure characterised by hypotension i.e., systolic BP < 90 mmHg, or concurrent nitrate therapy
for angina (risk of cardiovascular collapse).

syncope).
21. Digoxin as first line treatment for long-term (> 3 months) ventricular rate control in atrial
fibrillation (increased mortality from long-term digoxin use; cardio-selective beta-blockers are
generally preferable).
Section C: Coagulation System
1. Long-term aspirin at doses greater than 100mg per day (increased risk of bleeding, no
evidence for increased efficacy).
2. Antiplatelet agents, vitamin K antagonists, direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors
with concurrent significant risk of major bleeding, i.e. uncontrolled severe hypertension,
bleeding diathesis, recent non-trivial spontaneous bleeding (high risk of bleeding).
3. Aspirin plus clopidogrel as long-term secondary stroke prevention i.e., > 4 weeks, unless
the patient has a coronary stent(s) inserted in the previous 12 months or concurrent acute
coronary syndrome or has a high grade symptomatic carotid arterial stenosis (no evidence of
added long-term benefit over clopidogrel monotherapy).
4. Antiplatelet agents in combination with vitamin K antagonist, direct thrombin inhibitor or
factor Xa inhibitors in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, unless there is concurrent
coronary artery stent(s) inserted or angiographically proven high grade (> 50%) coronary

11. Vitamin K antagonist as first-line anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation, unless there is
concurrent metallic heart valve in-situ, moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, or eGFR < 15
mls/min./1.73m2 (direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors are equally efficacious and
safer than vitamin K antagonists).

olanzapine, pipothiazine, promazine, thioridazine) with a history of lower urinary tract
symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia or previous urinary retention (high
risk of urinary retention).

hyponatraemia i.e., serum Na+ < 130 mmol/l (risk of exacerbating or precipitating
hyponatraemia).
7. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI’s) with current or recent significant bleeding
(risk of exacerbation or recurrence of bleeding due to antiplatelet effects of SSRI’s).
8. Benzodiazepines for ≥ 4 weeks (no indication for longer treatment; risk of prolonged
sedation, confusion, impaired balance, falls, road traffic accidents; all benzodiazepines should
be withdrawn gradually if taken for more than 4 weeks as there is a risk of causing a

dementia (not recommended in summary of product characteristics; increased risk of
confusion, hypotension, extra-pyramidal side effects, falls).

nausea/vomiting/vertigo, chlorpromazine for relief of persistent hiccoughs and
levomepromazine as an anti-emetic in palliative care).
22. Levodopa or dopamine agonists for benign essential tremor (no evidence of efficacy)
23. Levodopa or dopamine agonists for treatment of extrapyramidal side-effects of
antipsychotics or other forms of drug-induced Parkinsonism (inappropriate prescribing
cascade to be avoided).
24. First-generation antihistamines as first-line treatment for allergy or pruritus (safer
antihistamines with fewer side-effects now widely available).

1. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) with chronic, active and disabling
rheumatoid arthritis.
2. Bisphosphonates and vitamin D and calcium in patients taking long-term systemic
corticosteroid therapy for prevention of steroid-induced osteoporosis.
3. Vitamin D in patients with known osteoporosis and/or previous fragility fracture(s) and/or
Bone Mineral Density T-scores below -2.5 in one or multiple sites.
4. Bone anti-resorptive or anabolic therapy (e.g., bisphosphonate, teriparatide, denosumab)
in patients with documented osteoporosis (Bone Mineral Density T-scores below -2.5 in one
or multiple sites) and/or previous history of fragility fracture(s) – where no pharmacological
or clinical status contraindication exists such as poor one-year life expectancy.
5. Vitamin D supplement in older people with confirmed 25-hydroxycolecalciferol deficiency
(< 20 micrograms/L, < 50 nmol/L) who are housebound or experiencing falls or with
osteopenia (Bone Mineral Density T-score is less than -1.0 but above -2.5 in one or multiple
sites).
6. Anti-resorptive treatment after discontinuation of at least two doses of denosumab
(rebound increased bone turnover markers, BMD loss, and increased risk of vertebral fracture
following denosumab discontinuation).
7. Anti-resorptive treatment after discontinuation of teriparatide/abaloparatide treatment
for osteoporosis.
8. Xanthine-oxidase inhibitors (e.g. allopurinol, febuxostat) with a history of recurrent
episodes of gout.
9. Folic acid supplement in patients taking methotrexate.
Section I: Urogenital System
1. Selective alpha-1 receptor blocker (e.g., tamsulosin, silodosin) for lower urinary tract
symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia where prostatectomy is not considered
necessary or appropriate or safe.
2. 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride) for lower urinary tract symptoms
related to benign prostatic hyperplasia where prostatectomy is not considered necessary or
appropriate or safe.
3. Topical vaginal oestrogen or vaginal oestrogen pessary for symptomatic atrophic vaginitis.
4. Topical vaginal oestrogen or vaginal oestrogen pessary in women for recurrent urinary tract
infections.
5. Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (e.g., avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) for
persistent erectile dysfunction that causes distress.
Section J: Endocrine System
1. ACE inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (if intolerant of ACE inhibitor) in diabetes
with evidence of renal disease i.e., dipstick proteinuria or microalbuminuria (>30 mg/24
hours) unless evidence of severe CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/m2).
Section K: Analgesics
1. High-potency opioids in moderate-severe non-arthritis pain, where paracetamol, NSAIDs
or low-potency opioids are not appropriate to the pain severity or have been ineffective.
2. Laxatives in patients receiving opioids regularly i.e., other than PRN use.
3. Topical 5% lidocaine (lignocaine) patch for localized neuropathic pain, e.g. post-herpetic
neuralgia.
Section L: Vaccines
1. Seasonal influenza vaccine annually.
2. Pneumococcal vaccine at least once according to national guidelines.
3. Varicella-zoster vaccine according to national guidelines.
4. SARS-CoV2 vaccine according to national guidelines.
