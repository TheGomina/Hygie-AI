Appendix 1
Screening Tool of Older Persons’ Prescriptions (STOPP) version 3.
The following prescriptions are potentially inappropriate to use in patients aged 65 years
and older.
Section A: Indication of medication
1. Any drug prescribed without a clinical indication.
2. Any drug prescribed beyond the recommended duration, where treatment duration is well
defined.
3. Any duplicate drug class prescription for daily regular use (as distinct from PRN use) e.g.,
two concurrent NSAIDs, SSRIs, loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors, anticoagulants, antipsychotics,
opioid analgesics (optimisation of monotherapy within a single drug class should be observed
prior to considering a new agent).
Section B: Cardiovascular System
1. Digoxin for heart failure with normal systolic ventricular function (no clear evidence of
benefit)
2. Verapamil or diltiazem with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (may worsen heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction i.e., HFREF).
3. Beta-blocker in combination with verapamil or diltiazem (risk of heart block).
4. Ventricular rate-limiting drugs i.e., beta blocker, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin with
bradycardia (< 50/min), type II heart block or complete heart block (risk of complete heart
block, asystole).
5. Beta-blocker as monotherapy for uncomplicated hypertension i.e., not associated with
angina pectoris, aortic aneurysm or other condition where beta-blocker therapy is indicated
(no firm evidence of efficacy).
6. Amiodarone as first-line antiarrhythmic therapy in supraventricular tachyarrhythmias
(higher risk of major side-effects than beta-blockers, digoxin, verapamil or diltiazem).
7. Loop diuretic as first-line treatment for hypertension unless there is concurrent heart
failure requiring diuretic therapy (safer, more effective alternatives available).
8. Loop diuretic for dependent ankle oedema without clinical, biochemical or radiological
evidence of heart failure, liver failure, nephrotic syndrome or renal failure (leg elevation and
/or compression hosiery usually more appropriate).
9. Thiazide diuretic with current significant hypokalaemia (i.e., serum K+ < 3.0 mmol/l),
hyponatraemia (i.e., serum Na+ < 130 mmol/l) hypercalcaemia (i.e., corrected serum calcium
> 2.65 mmol/l) or with a history of gout (hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and
gout can be precipitated by thiazide diuretic)
10. Loop diuretic for treatment of hypertension with concurrent urinary incontinence (may
exacerbate incontinence).
11. Centrally-acting antihypertensives e.g., methyldopa, clonidine, moxonidine, rilmenidine,
guanfacine (centrally-active antihypertensives are generally less well tolerated by older
people than younger people)
12. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers
(ARBs) in patients with hyperkalaemia i.e., serum K > 5.5 mmol/l.
13. Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone) with concurrent potassium-
conserving drugs (e.g., ACEI’s, ARB’s, amiloride, triamterene) without monitoring of serum
potassium (risk of dangerous hyperkalaemia i.e., > 6.0 mmol/l – serum K should be monitored
regularly, i.e., at least every 6 months).
14. Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) in severe heart
failure characterised by hypotension i.e., systolic BP < 90 mmHg, or concurrent nitrate therapy
for angina (risk of cardiovascular collapse).
15. Drugs that predictably prolong the QTc interval (QTc = QT/RR) in patients with known with
demonstrable QTc prolongation (to >450 msec in males and >470 msec in females), including
quinolones, macrolides, ondansetron, citalopram (doses > 20 mg/day), escitalopram (doses >
10 mg/day), tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, haloperidol, digoxin, class 1A antiarrhythmics,
class III antiarrhythmics, tizanidine, phenothiazines, astemizole, mirabegron (risk of life-
threatening ventricular arrhythmias).
16. Statins for primary cardiovascular prevention in persons aged ≥ 85 and established frailty
with expected life expectancy likely less than 3 years (lack of evidence of efficacy).
17. Long-term systemic i.e., non-topical NSAIDs with known history of coronary, cerebral or
peripheral vascular disease (increased risk of thrombosis).
18. Long-term antipsychotics with known history of coronary, cerebral or peripheral vascular
disease (increased risk of thrombosis).
19. NSAIDs or systemic corticosteroids with heart failure requiring loop diuretic therapy (risk
of exacerbation of heart failure).
20. Antihypertensive drugs in severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (risk of severe hypotension,
syncope).
21. Digoxin as first line treatment for long-term (> 3 months) ventricular rate control in atrial
fibrillation (increased mortality from long-term digoxin use; cardio-selective beta-blockers are
generally preferable).
Section C: Coagulation System
1. Long-term aspirin at doses greater than 100mg per day (increased risk of bleeding, no
evidence for increased efficacy).
2. Antiplatelet agents, vitamin K antagonists, direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors
with concurrent significant risk of major bleeding, i.e. uncontrolled severe hypertension,
bleeding diathesis, recent non-trivial spontaneous bleeding (high risk of bleeding).
3. Aspirin plus clopidogrel as long-term secondary stroke prevention i.e., > 4 weeks, unless
the patient has a coronary stent(s) inserted in the previous 12 months or concurrent acute
coronary syndrome or has a high grade symptomatic carotid arterial stenosis (no evidence of
added long-term benefit over clopidogrel monotherapy).
4. Antiplatelet agents in combination with vitamin K antagonist, direct thrombin inhibitor or
factor Xa inhibitors in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, unless there is concurrent
coronary artery stent(s) inserted or angiographically proven high grade (> 50%) coronary
artery stenosis (no added benefit from antiplatelet agents).
5. Antiplatelet agents with vitamin K antagonist, direct thrombin inhibitor or factor Xa
inhibitors in patients with stable coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease (no
evidence of added benefit from dual therapy).
6. Ticlopidine in any circumstances (clopidogrel and prasugrel have similar efficacy, stronger
evidence and fewer side-effects).
7. Antiplatelet agents as alternatives to vitamin K antagonists, direct thrombin inhibitors or
factor Xa inhibitors for stroke prevention in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (no
evidence of efficacy).
8. Vitamin K antagonist, direct thrombin inhibitor or factor Xa inhibitors for first deep venous
thrombosis without continuing provoking risk factors (e.g., thrombophilia) for longer than 6
months, (no proven added benefit).
9. Vitamin K antagonist, direct thrombin inhibitor or factor Xa inhibitors for first pulmonary
embolus without continuing provoking risk factors (e.g., thrombophilia) for longer than 12
months (no proven added benefit).
10. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and vitamin K antagonist, direct thrombin
inhibitor or factor Xa inhibitors in combination (risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding).
11. Vitamin K antagonist as first-line anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation, unless there is
concurrent metallic heart valve in-situ, moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, or eGFR < 15
mls/min./1.73m2 (direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors are equally efficacious and
safer than vitamin K antagonists).
12. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in combination with Vitamin K antagonist,
direct thrombin inhibitor or factor Xa inhibitor with a previous history of major haemorrhage
(increased risk of bleeding due to antiplatelet effects of SSRIs).
13. Direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., dabigatran) and diltiazem or verapamil (increased risk of
bleeding).
14. Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump

conduction abnormalities, prostatism, chronic constipation, recent falls, prior history of
urinary retention or orthostatic hypotension (risk of worsening these conditions).

(higher risk of adverse drug reactions with TCAs than with SSRIs or SNRIs).
3. Serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI’s e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine) and
severe hypertension i.e., systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg +/- diastolic blood pressure >

(acepromazine, chlorpromazine, clozapine, flupenthixol, fluphenzine, levomepromazine,
olanzapine, pipothiazine, promazine, thioridazine) with a history of lower urinary tract
symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia or previous urinary retention (high
risk of urinary retention).
5. Antipsychotics prescribed for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)
an unchanged dose for > 3 months without medication review (increased risk of
extrapyramidal side-effects and chronic worsening of cognition, increased risk of major
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality).
6. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI’s) with current or recent significant
hyponatraemia i.e., serum Na+ < 130 mmol/l (risk of exacerbating or precipitating
hyponatraemia).
7. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI’s) with current or recent significant bleeding
(risk of exacerbation or recurrence of bleeding due to antiplatelet effects of SSRI’s).
8. Benzodiazepines for ≥ 4 weeks (no indication for longer treatment; risk of prolonged
sedation, confusion, impaired balance, falls, road traffic accidents; all benzodiazepines should
be withdrawn gradually if taken for more than 4 weeks as there is a risk of causing a
benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome if stopped abruptly).
9. Benzodiazepines for agitated behaviour or psychotic symptoms of dementia (no evidence
of efficacy).
10. Benzodiazepines for insomnia for ≥ 2 weeks (high risk of dependency, increased risk of

fractures).
12. Antipsychotics (i.e., other than clozapine or quetiapine) in those with parkinsonism or
Dementia with Lewy Bodies (risk of severe extra-pyramidal symptoms).
13. Anticholinergic/antimuscarinic drugs (biperiden, orphenadrine, procyclidine,
trihexyphenidyl) to treat extra-pyramidal side-effects of antipsychotic medications (risk of

dementia (risk of exacerbation of cognitive impairment).
15. Antipsychotics in patients with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia
(BPSD) for longer than 12 weeks unless BPSD symptoms are severe and other non-
pharmacological treatments have failed (increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction).
16. Antipsychotics as hypnotics, unless sleep disorder is due to psychosis or BPSD effects of
dementia (not recommended in summary of product characteristics; increased risk of
confusion, hypotension, extra-pyramidal side effects, falls).
17. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with a known history of persistent bradycardia (< 60
beats/min.), heart block or recurrent unexplained syncope (risk of cardiac conduction failure,
syncope and injury).

persistent bradycardia (< 60 beats/min.) such as beta-blockers, digoxin, diltiazem, verapamil
(risk of cardiac conduction failure, syncope and injury).

acids, panax ginseng, rhodiola, creatine (no evidence of efficacy).
21. Phenothiazines as first-line treatment for psychosis or non-cognitive symptoms of
dementia, since safer and more efficacious alternatives exist (phenothiazines are sedative,
have significant anti-muscarinic toxicity in older people, except for prochlorperazine for
nausea/vomiting/vertigo, chlorpromazine for relief of persistent hiccoughs and
levomepromazine as an anti-emetic in palliative care).
22. Levodopa or dopamine agonists for benign essential tremor (no evidence of efficacy)
23. Levodopa or dopamine agonists for treatment of extrapyramidal side-effects of
antipsychotics or other forms of drug-induced Parkinsonism (inappropriate prescribing
cascade to be avoided).
24. First-generation antihistamines as first-line treatment for allergy or pruritus (safer
antihistamines with fewer side-effects now widely available).
25. First-generation antihistamines for insomnia (high risk of side-effects, Z-drugs safer and
more appropriate for short-term use).
Section E: Renal System.
1. Digoxin at a long-term (i.e. more than 90 days) maintenance dose ≥ 125μg/day if eGFR < 30
ml/min/1.73m2 (risk of digoxin toxicity if plasma levels not measured).
2. Direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran) if eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 (risk of bleeding)
3. Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) if eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73m2
(risk of bleeding)
4. NSAID’s if eGFR < 50 ml/min/1.73m2 (risk of deterioration in renal function).

Section F: Gastrointestinal System
1. Prochlorperazine or metoclopramide with Parkinsonism (risk of exacerbating Parkinsonian
symptoms).
2. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease at full therapeutic
dosage for > 8 weeks (dose reduction or earlier discontinuation or H2 antagonist maintenance
therapy usually indicated).
3. Drugs likely to cause constipation (e.g. systemic antimuscarinics, oral iron, opioids,
verapamil, aluminium antacids) with chronic constipation where non-constipating
alternatives are available (risk of exacerbation of constipation).
4. Oral elemental iron doses greater than 200 mg daily (e.g. ferrous fumarate> 600 mg/day,
ferrous sulphate > 600 mg/day, ferrous gluconate> 1800 mg/day; no evidence of enhanced
iron absorption above these doses).
5. Corticosteroids with a history of peptic ulcer disease or erosive oesophagitis (risk of relapse
unless proton pump inhibitor is co-prescribed).
6. Antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs with a history of Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia (GAVE,
“watermelon stomach”) (risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding).
7. Antipsychotics with dysphagia (increased risk of aspiration pneumonia).
8. Megestrol acetate to increase appetite (increased risk of thrombosis and death with
unproven efficacy)
Section G: Respiratory System
1. Theophylline as monotherapy for COPD (safer, more effective alternative; risk of adverse
effects due to narrow therapeutic index).
2. Systemic corticosteroids instead of inhaled corticosteroids for maintenance therapy in
moderate-severe COPD (unnecessary exposure to long-term side-effects of systemic
corticosteroids and effective inhaled therapies are available).
3. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (e.g., tiotropium, aclidinium, umeclidinium,
glycopyrronium) with a history of narrow angle glaucoma (may exacerbate glaucoma) or
bladder outflow obstruction (may cause urinary retention).

mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure consistently above 100 mmHg (risk of exacerbation of
hypertension).
3. Long-term use of NSAID (>3 months) for symptom relief of osteoarthritis pain where
paracetamol has not been tried (simple analgesics preferable and usually as effective for pain
relief and safer).
4. Long-term corticosteroids (>3 months) as monotherapy for rheumatoid arthritis (risk of
systemic corticosteroid side-effects).
5. Corticosteroids (other than periodic intra-articular injections for mono-articular pain) for
osteoarthritis (risk of systemic corticosteroid side-effects).
6. Long-term NSAID or colchicine (>3 months) for chronic treatment of gout where there is no
contraindication to a xanthine-oxidase inhibitor (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat) (xanthine-
oxidase inhibitors are first choice prophylactic drugs in gout).
7. NSAID with concurrent corticosteroids for treatment of arthritis/rheumatism of any kind
(increased risk of peptic ulcer disease).
8. Oral bisphosphonates in patients with a current or recent history of upper gastrointestinal
